# Clients Module - CRM System
A React-based client management interface that allows users to view, add, and manage client information, and to view contracts and projects.

## Live Demo Available

The easiest way to review the application is through the live deployment at:
https://clients-module.vercel.app/clients

**Demo Login Credentials:**
- Email: domalley@liberty.edu
- Password: capstone

The live version uses Supabase as the backend and contains the most up-to-date data.

## Local Development Setup (Optional)

If you wish to run the code locally:

1. **Extract the Project**
   - Unzip the project file to your desired location
   - Open a terminal/command prompt
   - Navigate to the project directory

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000` and will connect to the same Supabase backend as the live demo.
